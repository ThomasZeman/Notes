- Install XCode
- Install Visual Studio Community
- Install MonoGame for Mac
- Install Nuget CLI or self update
- Mount nuget package share because nuget cannot connect to samba share directly (https://superuser.com/questions/336665/how-to-automount-smb-shared-network-drives-in-mac-os-x-lion)
- Add nuget source(s)
- Ensure that share is accessible after reboot without any manual interaction. Otherwise I have seen Visual Studio crashing upon opening solution with some error 87.
